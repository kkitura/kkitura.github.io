            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="long-block">I am a young hobbyist who is starting to get into making websites. 
                I wanted to take the challenge of my making my own websites and creating a virtual
                space for myself. (Almost like my own metaverse island.) I currently am in Wallace Community College,
                working for an Associates Degree in Computer Informational Science. I put my concentration(minor)
                towards being a software developer. I also love the art of all types.
                Traditional, Digital, Comic Book, Anime, Designs, Animations, and more!
